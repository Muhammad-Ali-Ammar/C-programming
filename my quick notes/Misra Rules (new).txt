-- MISRA C is a subset of C language for critical systems where that critical systems are the systems in which people might die due to software bugs

-- MISRA is stands for Motor Industry Software Reliability Association.

-- its advantage : 

		 Can force the developer to avoid features in C that could  cause problems like	Execution Error.
			-out of bounds array reference
			-divide by zero
			-uninitialized variable usage


-- in function , just 1 return 


-- if condition , use { } if it were 1 statement 

-- MISRA C Rule 5.2
	Identifiers in an inner scope shall not use the	same name as an identifier in the outer scope
		
		Int total;
		Int foo (int total ){
		return 3* total;
		}

2- fel gam3 wl multiplication ,, a3ml 7saab al overflow 

3- lma tb3t le function.. ab3t by reference and make it const ,, 3shan may3mlsh (overhead of making a copy ) 

4- lma t3ml malloc,realloc,etc ,, check if the returned address is NULL or not (fe mkan w at7gz wala la2)

	if(pDyArray=(int*) malloc(size*sizeof(int))==NULL) return 1;//terminate the program
	if(arr=realloc(arr, elements * sizeof(int))== NULL) {return 1;}

6- not preferable to be there input/output operations in functions/classes, you can use it for testing only
