-- what is c ? 
	•• createed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 
	•• a middle level language , it combines low level access ( assembly) , higher level languages
	•• a structure programming langauge 
	•• it's a procedural language --> divide a task to into functions 
	
-- C features 
	•• few keywords = 32 
	•• structure union , array, pointer , macros , standard lib 
	•• controls memory layout 


-- C lacks 
	•• exceptions ( divide by 0 , ... ) = run time error 
	•• Range checking ( no limt for array maslun"overflow or underflow" arr[-1] , access 4 byte using 2 bytes ) 

	•• No automatic garbage collection 
			Automatic garbage collection : is the process of looking at heap memory, identifying which objects are in use and which are not, 
				and deleting the unused objects
	•• No support for OOP


	

-- c vs c++ 

	•• c is better because portability , effiency , and smaller size

-- c is better than assembly because of portability ,, assembly depends on machine 

-- what is the meaning of middle language ? 
	-- direct access to memory through pointers
	-- writing assembly code within c codes 
	
-- not all c compilers support single line comment // 

-- ANSI C = American National Standards Institute = standard of C language

-- c and c++ are different languages 

	char *s = malloc(100);

	This is correct C code, but in C++ this code is invalid. 
	This is because malloc() return "void *". In C you can cast void * to any other pointer type. 
	In C++ you can not. You should cast:

	char *s = (char *) malloc(100)
