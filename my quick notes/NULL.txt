-- NULL Pointer points to nowhere
-- NULL is in stdio.h 
-- NULL is 0l or just 0 

-- null string = null char = "" ; // where size of it = 1 
-- #define NULL (void *)0

-- NULL is not like '\0' 
	'\0' = 1 byte  = empty char 
	NULL is an address
	
	
	both of them is 0, but NULL is an address, null is character where its ascii is 0 
	
	
	
	
    char arr[]={'a',0};  // 0 is similar to '/0'

    cout(strlen(arr)); //  1
