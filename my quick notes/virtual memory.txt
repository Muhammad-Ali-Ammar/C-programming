-- is memory section virtual or physical ? 


	They're virtual sections, there's not a separated memory called stack for example. 
	You can control the start address and the size of each section in linker script. 
	You can even create new section and give it any name you want also from linker script.
	you gave the first address is 0x00 , and it's not physical 




-- physical memory : 

	•• examples 
		1- cache 
		2- ram 
		3- hard disks 
		4- removable storage 
		
	•• it's very limited in embedded system
		
		
-- virtual memory =  abstracted addressable space 
	
	-- it is an OS abstracted addressable space accessible by your code 
	-- memory mangement in OS  is resposibl for mapping between vitual and physical 
	-- size of virtual memory depends on OS = sizeof pointer of os ,, 4 bytes = 2^32 = 4Gbyte
	-- useful : in ay code momkn t3ml reference lel address mn 2wl zero 3ala ay machine
