1- implicit casting :automatically done by the compiler 
	
	float x = 3.5;
	int y = x;  // implicit casting
	
	•• Pormotion type = automatic cast = automatic type conversion = when more than 1 type present = lower to higher
	
2- explicit casting : by the programmer 


	int x = 3,y=4;
	float z = (float)x/y;
	
	

 // casting = type conversion 
 // the aim is to convert data type without losing its orignial meaning 
 
 /* but it could be lost due to signed to unsigned conversion 
	and overflow from long long (8) to float (4) 
	
		bool< char<unsigned char  < short int<unsigned short int < int < unsigned int < long <unsigned long <long long <unsigned long long < float < double < long double
