int main()
{

    char a = 30, b = 40 , c = 10;

    char result =  (a*b)/c;

    cout(result);

}



// result is 120 ( fine no overflow ) 


// note that arthmatic on char makes (integration promotion) 


 (a*b)/c = ((int)a/b)/c ,,, al final result fits to 8 bit = into char 3adiii 
 
 but a*b only and set that into char ---> overflow happens 
 
 
 char result = a*b = (int)a*b 
 
 cout(result); // -80
