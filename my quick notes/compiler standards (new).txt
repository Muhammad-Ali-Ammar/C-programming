2- ANSI C  = c89
3- C90
4- C95
5- C99 
6- c11 



in c89 : 
-- for(int i = 0 //.. ) error , lazm i bara 
-- warnning if you didn't write return 0; 
-- The C89 standard doesn't allow variable sized arrays = Variable Length Arrays = VLA 
	int size = 5 ; 
	int arr[size ]; // error ,,, works fine in c99 


in c11:

-- Adds new features generic macros, anonymous structures, improved Unicode support, atomic operations, multi-threading, and bounds-checked functions.
• It also makes some portions of the existing C99 library optional, and improves compatibility with C++.


in Embedded C:
• Includes features not available in C like fixed-point arithmetic, named address spaces,and basic I/O hardware addressing.


in (K&R ) :

• in the original C,(Kernighan & Ritchie, 1st Edition) it was not possible to pass a structure, only a pointer to a structure could be passed. 
• malloc, calloc return char* not void* ,, where you needed to cast it to int for example ,, but void* no need for that
