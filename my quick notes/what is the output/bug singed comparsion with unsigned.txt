#define TOTAL_ELEMENTS (sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0])) 


	int main() 
	{
		 int x= 1; 
		 int d= 0;

		d--;
		if (d <= TOTAL_ELEMENTS) 
		x = array[d+1];

**** Answer is 1 *****

note that : sizeof(array) = unsinged int 


unsigned char <= signed char ---> signed char 
unsigned short <= signed short ---> signed short 


unsigned int <= signed int ---> unsigned int
